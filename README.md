Chuan-Self-Study
================

This project is an outgrowth of a collaboration between the University of North Florida's School of Computing 
and their College of Education to create a machine learning based American Sign Language alphabet recognition system utilizing the LEAP Motionsensor. This project currently does not use the leap motion sdk. In fact, this parser only work with leap motion data that has been put in a very specific format. The code is here to help anyone interested in this area 
of research and is looking for some ideas.

This project was coded by myself, Eric Regina, with the guidance of Dr. Ching-Hua Chuan of UNF.
